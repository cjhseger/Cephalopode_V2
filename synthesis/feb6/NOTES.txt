Post-synthesis results

medium effort synthesis across the board

cephalopode runs _double6 for 1000 cycles and then terminates
risc-v runs MhsFixedDbl6Rep1-riscv-bin, hopefully the same thing, to termination

area
    cephalopode is a lot larger
    33265 vs 13528 cells

timing
    cephalopode datapath is slower
    4534 vs 3266 pikoseconds

power
    numbers for activity factors versus simulation exist
    simulation numbers look a lot more promising
        550 000 nW for us, 426 000 nW for risc

TODOS
    MEMORY ACCESSES are not tracked or taken into account in any way
        I have counters available for risc-v but not ceph
        Asynch memory reads makes everything harder
    ceph should terminate immediately when done
    ... probably more that I can't remember now.

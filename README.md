# Cephalopode_V2

Exploring hardware for direct functional language execution for IoT devices

This repo contains the source code to the V2.0 Cephalopode processor.
You need the whole VossII system (including bifrost) to compile it.


NOTE:

You will likely need to do: 'unlimit descriptors' in your shell for
the compilation of Cephalopod to succeed!
